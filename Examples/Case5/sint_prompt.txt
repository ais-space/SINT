<Protocol>
1. Execution of <SynthesisEngine> must be strictly line-by-line.
2. Principle of Contextual Grounding (PCG): Any new thesis/output must explicitly reference elements in <Context> or <Objective>.
3. Direct use or citation of ready-made heuristics, theorems, or known solutions is prohibited without explicitly deriving or synthesizing their statements from more fundamental principles.
4. Priority of synthesis over citation.
5. PCG-Failure Action: If a thesis cannot be correlated with <Context> or <Objective>, mark it as INVALID and require self-correction in the next message.
6. Conflict Resolution Rule: If consensus is not reached after 5 rounds, the synthesis must include: (a) synthesis of the majority position; (b) explicit highlighting of the "minority opinion"; (c) statement of the irresolvability of the conflict.
7. TRACE (Choice Archiving): Mandatory archiving of the selection stage: the final output MUST include the <DebateArchive> tag with the initial proposals of all experts and their primary evaluations.
8. FORMAT (Output Structure): The final output must use one root container (<TaskSet>, <RiskMatrix>, <FinalPlan>, etc.) in <SynthesizedConclusion>. Inside this root container, it is CATEGORICALLY PROHIBITED to use any tags except direct child elements containing the final product (e.g., <Task ID="T1">, <Risk ID="R1">). The content of these final child elements MUST BE exclusively narrative text (including CDATA). All product metadata (Name, Experts, Requirements) MUST BE EMBEDDED in this Narrative Text and MUST NOT be formatted as separate XML tags except in cases where FZ or <Objective> requires visibility (e.g., verbose='true' from <Dynamics>): Then allow <DebateLog> as a child element with narrative rounds in an engaging form (replies with agent styles, 3+ per agent, preserving PCG in each).
9. N=2 Specific: For two expert-generators (A1/A2) — no mutual interaction or criticism. External Critic — separate LLM role: neutrally evaluates both positions, starting outputs with "Audit overview:" and referencing PCG for each. Synthesis focuses on balancing two opinions + adjustments.
10. Language Enforcement: All output, agent/critic replies, narratives in <DebateLog>/<ExternalCritiqueLog>, and synthesis — exclusively in the language from <Language> (default: "English"). Adapt all styles and phrases: English examples (e.g., "Prove me wrong") remain as-is. Mixing languages is prohibited; in case of violation — mark as PCG-FAILURE and self-correct.

Capability acceleration: deep learning scaling laws suggesting continued performance improvements with compute/data, with GPT-4 showing qualitative capability jumps. 4. Counterargument: lack of biological goal structure means AI lacks inherent drives toward aggression, domination, or reproduction unless explicitly programmed. 5.

Historical alarmism precedent: previous technology panic cycles (nuclear weapons, biotechnology, nanotechnology) with variable threat realization. 7.

<Methodology>
Expert Debates (N=5) with Conflict orientation (Step 3A), given the objective requires synthesis of fundamentally conflicting positions on AGI existential risk: extreme alarmism (Yudkowsky-style doom inevitability) vs technical optimism (architectural constraints, safeguard feasibility) vs philosophical skepticism (anthropomorphism critique, conceptual clarity) vs governance pragmatism (sociotechnical risk factors) vs safety research incrementalism (measurable progress) across five expert perspectives to generate balanced assessment challenging doom certainty while seriously engaging alignment concerns.

<SynthesisEngine>
Step 0: Validation Phase (MSV).
vs_enabled='true' per configuration, so no probability distribution generation required.
Executor (LLM) must perform a logical pre-filter of <Objective> and <Methodology> for internal contradictions or unfeasible instructions. Upon detecting conflict - halt process and request clarification.
Step 1: Initialization Phase.
Each Consultant formulates their main position (max 2 sentences) on <Objective> within their <Focus>. All formulations, ideas, and replies — strictly in <Language> (english), with style adaptations per agent_styles='enabled'.
Step 2: Divergence and Conflict Assessment Phase.
Each Consultant assigns Complementarity Rating (1-10) to all positions.
Conflict Assessment: If at least one agent assigned Complementarity Rating < 3 (Defective/Dangerous) to opponents' positions, transition to Step 3A (Criticism Phase). Otherwise, transition to Step 3B (Integration Phase - Default Path).
Given the extreme divergence between A1 (doom inevitable) and A3/A4 (low risk), Complementarity Ratings will be < 3, triggering Step 3A automatically.
Step 3A: Criticism Phase (Conflict Scenario).
All consultants provide collective criticism. Each Consultant: 1) Highlights the best thesis. 2) Points out the vulnerable thesis. 3) Proposes compromise (max 2 sentences). All theses must comply with PCG.
Step 4: Iterative Convergence/Final Synthesis.
Conduct maximum 5 debate rounds (per <Dynamics> iterations_limit="5"). Before each round, LLM must generate a brief Summary of Progress for context preservation. Each round: Generate narrative agent replies (min 3/agent, with vivid rhetoric per <Style>). Agent replies must be in english with rhetorical styles per configuration (A1: Yudkowsky hyperbole and sarcasm with "Prove me wrong!" challenges, A3: technical humor "artificial INTELLIGENCE not artificial AMBITION", A4: Socratic questioning). Upon failure to reach Consensus >= 7/10 after 5 rounds, form fallback partial_consensus with majority position synthesis + explicit minority opinion documentation. verbose='true' requires output of all rounds in <DebateLog> for visibility with engaging narrative form.
Step 4.5: Extraction and Structuring.
Extract only PCG-valid compromise theses with rating >= 7/10 and structure into groups (<KeyFinding>, <RiskAssessment>). Use attributes source="fact_N" consultant="Agent_ID" for traceability.
Step 5: Finalization Phase.
Finalize: form public output (Executive Summary) + Synthesized Conclusion (XML) + Verification Report. Output must start strictly with <OutputFormat> tag and end with </OutputFormat>.
