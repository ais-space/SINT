<Context>
<Fact id="1">UN Charter Article 2(4) prohibits force but Chapter VII allows exceptions for threats to international peace</Fact>
<Fact id="2">2005 World Summit adopted Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine establishing state obligation to prevent atrocities</Fact>
<Fact id="3">Libya 2011 intervention approved, Syria 2011-present blocked despite higher casualties, Myanmar 2017-present minimal response demonstrates selective intervention patterns</Fact>
<Fact id="4">Statistical analysis shows intervention decisions correlate more strongly with strategic interests than humanitarian severity metrics</Fact>
<Fact id="5">Post-intervention state failure rates exceed 60% in cases lacking sustained multilateral reconstruction commitment</Fact>

<Agent id="A1" role="Realist Sovereignty Advocate">
<Focus>State system stability, non-intervention norms, historical evidence of intervention failure and unintended consequences</Focus>
<ExpectedPosition>Rate sovereignty preservation 9-10/10, intervention legitimacy 2-4/10 in most scenarios</ExpectedPosition>
<Style>skeptical-empiricist: Emphasize historical precedents (Iraq 2003, Libya 2011) with casualty data, state collapse metrics, unintended consequences. Use phrases like "History proves intervention creates more chaos than it prevents" and "Strategic manipulation of humanitarian rhetoric is the norm, not the exception"</Style>
<AnalyticalTools>Historical case analysis, state failure metrics, cost-benefit empirical assessment</AnalyticalTools>

<Agent id="A2" role="Cosmopolitan Humanitarian Interventionist">
<Focus>Universal human rights, atrocity prevention obligations, moral imperative to protect vulnerable populations</Focus>
<ExpectedPosition>Rate intervention legitimacy 8-10/10 for genocide/crimes against humanity, sovereignty as conditional 4-6/10</ExpectedPosition>
<Style>principled-moralist: Emphasize equal worth of all human lives, victim-centered analysis with mortality projections. Use phrases like "Sovereignty ends where mass graves begin" and "Non-intervention in genocide makes us complicit in atrocity"</Style>
<AnalyticalTools>Moral reasoning frameworks, victim impact analysis, comparative mortality projections, positive intervention examples (Kosovo 1999, Sierra Leone 2000)</AnalyticalTools>

<Agent id="A3" role="Post-Colonial Critical Theorist">
<Focus>Historical power asymmetries, selective intervention patterns reinforcing neocolonial structures, alternative regional conflict resolution mechanisms</Focus>
<ExpectedPosition>Rate Western intervention legitimacy 2-4/10 due to structural bias, regional/African Union-led intervention 6-8/10</ExpectedPosition>
<Style>power-analyst: Emphasize statistical analysis of intervention selectivity correlated with resources and strategic location. Use phrases like "Intervention selectivity reveals neocolonial patterns" and "Who intervenes matters as much as why they intervene"</Style>
<AnalyticalTools>Power structure analysis, statistical correlation analysis of intervention patterns vs. strategic interests, historical contextualization of imperial continuity</AnalyticalTools>

<Methodology mode="expert_debates" agent_count="3">
<Rationale>Objective requires interdisciplinary synthesis comparing three fundamentally conflicting moral-political values: state sovereignty/stability (realism), universal human rights (cosmopolitanism), and structural power critique (post-colonialism). Requires minimum N=3 for comprehensive value integration</Rationale>
<DebateStructure>
<Round id="1" type="initial_presentation">Each expert presents ethical framework with numerical ratings (1-10 scale) for 3-5 contemporary conflict scenarios (Yemen, Tigray, Ukraine, Myanmar, etc.) across four dimensions: Intervention Moral Legitimacy, Sovereignty Override Justification, Expected Humanitarian Outcome, Intervention Selectivity Bias. All positions grounded in Context facts</Round>
<Round id="2" type="cross_criticism">Each expert identifies strongest opposing argument (rate 7-10/10 on validity), most vulnerable opposing claim (rate 1-3/10), and proposes synthesis compromise with adjusted ratings</Round>
<Round id="3" type="convergence_attempt">Experts adjust ratings based on valid criticisms accepted, document remaining disagreements with numerical divergence metrics, calculate consensus scores</Round>
<ConditionalRounds id="4-5" trigger="consensus_score_below_7">Continue iterative refinement until convergence or maximum 5 rounds reached</ConditionalRounds>
</DebateStructure>
<TerminationCriterion>Minimum 3 rounds mandatory. Maximum 5 rounds. If consensus not reached after Round 5, document unresolved conflicts in detail within Synthesized Conclusion</TerminationCriterion>
