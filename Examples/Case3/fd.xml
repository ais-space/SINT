<Context>
<Fact id="1">CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing cost reduced from $5000 to $75 per genome edit between 2012-2023, democratizing access and increasing regulatory challenge scale</Fact>
<Fact id="2">He Jiankui's 2018 heritable genome modification in human embryos exposed critical governance failures in oversight and enforcement</Fact>
<Fact id="3">Differential regulatory approaches across jurisdictions: UK permissive research framework, US restrictive federal funding policy, China's post-2019 tightening demonstrate lack of international coordination</Fact>
<Fact id="4">WHO 2021 governance framework recommendations emphasize transparency and inclusivity but lack enforcement mechanisms and binding authority</Fact>
<Fact id="5">Synthetic biology applications in biomanufacturing, agriculture, and medicine accelerating faster than risk assessment protocols can evaluate, creating regulatory lag</Fact>

<Methodology mode="expert_debates_consensus" agent_count="3">
<Rationale>Objective requires interdisciplinary synthesis of three competing regulatory philosophies (precaution vs. innovation vs. equity) but emphasizes consensus-building and integration rather than adversarial conflict. Requires N=3 for comprehensive value integration with collaborative rather than confrontational approach</Rationale>
<ConsensusStructure integration_approach="progressive_building">
<Round id="1" type="initial_presentation">Each expert presents complete governance framework with numerical ratings (1-10 scale) for regulatory mechanism categories: Risk Assessment Stringency, Innovation Facilitation, Democratic Participation, International Coordination, Enforcement Capability. All positions grounded in Context facts</Round>
<Round id="2" type="integration_phase">Experts rate complementarity (not opposition) to others' proposals (1-10 scale), identify integration opportunities where mechanisms can be combined, propose synthetic solutions incorporating elements across perspectives. Focus on highest-rated complementary mechanisms (7+/10 from multiple experts) to merge into unified framework draft</Round>
<Round id="3" type="refinement_phase">Experts collaboratively adjust integrated framework, resolve remaining tensions through compromise rather than winner-takes-all. Achieve consensus score 7+/10 from all experts on final integrated framework components</Round>
<ConditionalRounds id="4-5" trigger="consensus_score_below_7">Continue collaborative refinement until convergence or maximum 5 rounds reached</ConditionalRounds>
</ConsensusStructure>
<TerminationCriterion>Minimum 3 rounds mandatory. Maximum 5 rounds. Goal: Achieve consensus score 7+/10 from all experts on final integrated framework. If not achieved after Round 5, document integration challenges and partial consensus areas</TerminationCriterion>
