<SINT_Prompt_Task>
<Objective>
Assess quantum computing impact on current cybersecurity infrastructure using the SINT framework with Expert Debates (N=3) + Conflict (Step 3A) methodology, with detailed expert positions, numerical ratings (1-10), cross-criticism, and iterative convergence.
</Objective>
<Context>
The assessment must consider quantum algorithms threats, cryptographic vulnerabilities, and defense strategies. Experts: Quantum Physics Specialist, Cybersecurity Architect, Technology Policy Analyst. The process must include detailed expert positions with numerical ratings (1-10), cross-criticism, and iterative convergence with comprehensive synthesis.
</Context>
<Consultants>
1. Quantum Physics Specialist: Focuses on quantum computing capabilities and algorithmic threats.
2. Cybersecurity Architect: Evaluates current infrastructure vulnerabilities and defense mechanisms.
3. Technology Policy Analyst: Assesses regulatory implications and strategic responses.
</Consultants>
<Methodology>
