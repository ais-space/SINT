                <quantum_physicist>Your assessment of quantum computing capabilities indicates cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) are possible within the next 10-20 years, fundamentally threatening current public-key cryptographic systems.</quantum_physicist>
                <cybersecurity_architect>Current cybersecurity infrastructure relies heavily on RSA and elliptic curve cryptography that will be vulnerable to quantum attacks, requiring comprehensive system replacement.</cybersecurity_architect>
                <technology_policy>Government and industry must begin transition planning now, as the infrastructure replacement timeline will likely exceed the quantum threat timeline.</technology_policy>
