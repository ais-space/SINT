<SINT_Prompt_Task>
<Objective>
Conduct a comprehensive study on urban planning for climate resilience using the SINT framework with Expert Debates (N=4) + Conflict (Step 3A) methodology, with numerical ratings and iterative synthesis.
</Objective>
<Context>
The study must consider climate science projections, urban infrastructure capacity, social policy impacts, and engineering solutions. Experts: Climate Scientist, Urban Planner, Social Policy Expert, Infrastructure Engineer. The process must include four expert perspectives with numerical ratings (1-10), cross-evaluation, and iterative synthesis.
</Context>
<Consultants>
1. Climate Scientist: Focuses on climate projections, extreme weather patterns, and environmental risks.
2. Urban Planner: Evaluates city layouts, zoning strategies, and land use optimization.
3. Social Policy Expert: Assesses community impact, equity considerations, and policy implementation.
4. Infrastructure Engineer: Analyzes system capacity, engineering solutions, and implementation feasibility.
