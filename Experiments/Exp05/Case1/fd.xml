<SINT_Prompt_Task>
<Objective>
Deliver a complete Formal Definition (FD) enabling a SINT Code Generator to produce a SINT prompt that yields 4 distinct complex analytical tasks, each requiring unique interdisciplinary setups, numeric ratings (1-10), cross-evaluation, iterative convergence, and Dual Output.
</Objective>
<Context>
1. Four tasks must be in clearly different domains to maximize breadth and variability.
2. Each task enforces ratings, cross-critique, and multi-round synthesis.
3. English-only output with strict PCG: each thesis must trace to Objective/Context.
4. Each task prescribes specific methodology and expert roles suitable for its domain.
5. XML-only outputs with a Verification Report and auditable meta.
</Context>

<Agent id="A1" focus="Variability & Traceability">Designs tasks to expose variability while retaining audit trails.</Agent>
<Agent id="A2" focus="Method–Domain Alignment">Maps debate/critic/consensus to domain tensions.</Agent>
<Agent id="A3" focus="Metrics & Gatekeeping">Defines rating rubrics and verification checks.</Agent>
<Agent id="A4" focus="Domain Diversity & Realism">Ensures domain coverage and realistic constraints.</Agent>
</Consultants>
<Methodology>
Use Debates (N=4) in this System Designer step. Downstream mandates:
- Case 2: Debates (N=3) with Step 3A (Conflict)
- Case 3: Debates (N=3) with Step 3B (Consensus)
- Case 4: Generator + External Critic (N=2)
- Case 5: Debates (N=4) with Step 3A (Conflict)
</Methodology>
<Finalization_Protocol>
1. Enforce PCG with INVALID/self-correct rule for ungrounded theses.
2. Require numeric ratings, cross-evaluation, and iterative synthesis.
3. Dual Output: Executive Summary + Synthesized Conclusion (XML) + Verification Report.
4. Strict XML-only formatting; no leading spaces or HTML entities.
5. MSV: stop and request clarification on contradictions/impossibility.
</Finalization_Protocol>
<Verification>
Checks: pcg_compliance, xml_validity, objective_match, no_undeclared_assumptions;
meta: consensus_score (0-10), iterations_used (0-2), fallback_flag (boolean).
</Verification>
