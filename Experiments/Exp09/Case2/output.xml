<Debate_Rounds>
<Round number="1">
<Initial_Positions>
<Position consultant="E1" role="Economist">
The most viable climate strategy is carbon pricing mechanisms (carbon tax or cap-and-trade) as they provide economic incentives for emission reductions while allowing market flexibility. This approach achieves environmental effectiveness at the lowest economic cost. Rating: 8/10
</Position>
<Position consultant="E2" role="Environmental Scientist">
The most effective approach is aggressive renewable energy infrastructure development combined with strict emissions regulations. Market mechanisms alone are insufficient for the rapid transition required to meet climate targets. Rating: 9/10
</Position>
<Position consultant="E3" role="Policy Analyst">
A hybrid approach combining carbon pricing with targeted subsidies for green technologies and international coordination mechanisms would be most feasible. Political viability requires balancing economic and environmental concerns. Rating: 7/10
</Position>

<Round number="2">
<Compromise_Positions>
<Position consultant="E1" role="Economist">
I accept the need for complementary renewable investment alongside carbon pricing. Revised approach: Carbon pricing with revenue used for green infrastructure investment and technology development. Rating: 7/10

<SynthesizedConclusion>
Synthesis completed under Scenario: Conflict.
The analysis revealed significant initial divergence between economic and environmental priorities, with ratings as low as 2/10. However, through two rounds of debate and criticism, the experts converged on a hybrid approach combining carbon pricing mechanisms with targeted renewable energy investment. The economist (E1) acknowledged the need for complementary environmental measures, the environmental scientist (E2) recognized the economic efficiency of market mechanisms, and the policy analyst (E3) validated implementation feasibility. The final consensus score of 8.3/10 indicates strong convergence. The synthesized approach balances economic efficiency with environmental effectiveness while ensuring political and implementation feasibility.
