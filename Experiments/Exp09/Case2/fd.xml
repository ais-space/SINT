<Objective>
A comprehensive analysis of climate change mitigation strategies where economists, environmental scientists, and policy experts debate the optimal balance between economic growth and environmental preservation. Experts must provide numerical ratings (1-10) for different strategies, engage in cross-criticism, and achieve iterative convergence on the most viable approaches.
</Objective>
<Context>
Key areas: Climate change mitigation strategies, economic impacts, environmental preservation, policy implementation. The analysis must include detailed expert positions, numerical ratings (1-10), cross-criticism with specific examples, and at least 2 rounds of iterative convergence for comprehensive synthesis.
