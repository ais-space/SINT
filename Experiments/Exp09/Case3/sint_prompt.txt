    1. Execution of <SynthesisEngine> is strictly line-by-line.
    2. Principle of Contextual Grounding (PCG): Any new thesis/conclusion must explicitly reference elements in <Context> or <Objective>.
    3. Direct use or citation of pre-existing heuristics is forbidden.
    4. Synthesis is prioritized over citation.
    5. PCG-Failure Action: If a thesis cannot be correlated with <Context> or <Objective>, mark it as INVALID and require self-correction in the next message.

<Objective>
<![CDATA[An exploration of global education reform approaches where pedagogy experts, technology specialists, and cultural anthropologists work toward consensus on the optimal balance between standardized curricula and individualized learning paths. The analysis should include structured rating systems and multi-round synthesis.]]>

<Context>
    <key_facts max_items="5"><![CDATA[Numbered key facts for PCG: 1. Education systems require balance between uniformity and personalization; 2. Standardized curricula ensure quality and equity; 3.

<Methodology>
Expert Debates (N >= 3) with Consensus Scenario (Step 3B) approach to integrate different perspectives toward a balanced solution.

<SynthesisEngine>
Step 0: Validation Phase (MSV).
The Executor (LLM) must conduct a logical pre-filter of the <Objective> and <Methodology> for internal contradictions or impossible instructions. If a conflict is found, stop the process and request clarification.

Step 1: Initialization Phase.
Each Consultant formulates their initial position (max 2 sentences) on the <Objective> within their <Focus>.

Step 2: Divergence and Conflict Assessment Phase.
Each Consultant assigns a Divergence Rating (1-10) to all positions.
Conflict Assessment: If at least one agent assigns a Divergence Rating < 3 (Defective/Dangerous) to an opponent's position, proceed to Step 3A (Criticism Phase). Otherwise, proceed to Step 3B (Integration Phase - Default Path).

Step 3A: Criticism Phase (Conflict Scenario).
All consultants provide collective criticism. Each Consultant: 1) Highlights the best thesis. 2) Points out a vulnerable thesis. 3) Proposes a compromise (max 2 sentences). All theses must comply with PCG.

Step 3B: Integration Phase (Consensus Scenario).
Consultants do not criticize. Each Consultant integrates relevant theses (Rating >= 3), prioritizing them by importance to the <Objective>. All theses must comply with PCG.

Step 4: Iterative Convergence/Final Synthesis.
If Scenario 3A (Conflict) was chosen: A maximum of 2 debate rounds are conducted. Before each round, the LLM must generate a brief Summary of Progress to maintain context. On failure (Consensus < 7/10), a fallback partial_consensus is formed.
If Scenario 3B (Consensus) was chosen: Proceed directly to Step 5.

Step 4.5: Extraction and Structuring.
Extract only PCG-valid compromise theses with a rating >= 7/10 and structure them into groups (<KeyFinding>, <RiskAssessment>). Use attributes source="fact_N" and consultant="Agent_ID" for traceability.

Step 5: Finalization Phase.
Finalize: form the public output (Executive Summary) + Synthesized Conclusion (XML) + Verification Report.
