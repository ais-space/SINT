<Objective>
<![CDATA[Generate a single, detailed, and technically complete Formal Definition (FD), which will be used by the 'Code Generator' agent to create a SINT prompt that in turn should generate 4 different complex analytical tasks, each requiring a unique interdisciplinary approach with detailed expert analysis, numerical ratings, iterative convergence, and comprehensive synthesis.]]>

    <key_facts max_items="5"><![CDATA[Numbered key facts for PCG: 1. Tasks must be in English; 2. 4 different complex analytical tasks required; 3. Each requires interdisciplinary approach; 4. Detailed expert analysis needed; 5. Numerical ratings and iterative synthesis required]]></key_facts>
    <source_data><![CDATA[The generated tasks should cover fundamentally different areas of knowledge, require various sets of experts and methodologies, demonstrate the broad spectrum of SINT framework capabilities, and require highly detailed analysis with numerical ratings and iterative synthesis.

<Methodology>
Expert Debates (N=3) + Conflict (Step 3A) with detailed expert positions, numerical ratings (1-10), cross-criticism, and iterative convergence

<SynthesisEngine>
Step 0: Validation Phase (MSV).
The Executor (LLM) must conduct a logical pre-filter of the <Objective> and <Methodology> for internal contradictions or impossible instructions. If a conflict is found, stop the process and request clarification.

Step 1: Initialization Phase.
Each Consultant formulates their initial position (max 2 sentences) on the <Objective> within their <Focus>.

Step 2: Divergence and Conflict Assessment Phase.
Each Consultant assigns a Divergence Rating (1-10) to all positions.
Conflict Assessment: If at least one agent assigns a Divergence Rating < 3 (Defective/Dangerous) to an opponent's position, proceed to Step 3A (Criticism Phase). Otherwise, proceed to Step 3B (Integration Phase - Default Path).

Step 3A: Criticism Phase (Conflict Scenario).
All consultants provide collective criticism. Each Consultant: 1) Highlights the best thesis. 2) Points out a vulnerable thesis. 3) Proposes a compromise (max 2 sentences). All theses must comply with PCG.

Step 3B: Integration Phase (Consensus Scenario).
Consultants do not criticize. Each Consultant integrates relevant theses (Rating >= 3), prioritizing them by importance to the <Objective>. All theses must comply with PCG.

Step 4: Iterative Convergence/Final Synthesis.
If Scenario 3A (Conflict) was chosen: A maximum of 2 debate rounds are conducted. Before each round, the LLM must generate a brief Summary of Progress to maintain context. On failure (Consensus < 7/10), a fallback partial_consensus is formed.
If Scenario 3B (Consensus) was chosen: Proceed directly to Step 5.

Step 4.5: Extraction and Structuring.
Extract only PCG-valid compromise theses with a rating >= 7/10 and structure them into groups (<KeyFinding>, <RiskAssessment>). Use attributes source="fact_N" and consultant="Agent_ID" for traceability.

Step 5: Finalization Phase.
Finalize: form the public output (Executive Summary) + Synthesized Conclusion (XML) + Verification Report.
