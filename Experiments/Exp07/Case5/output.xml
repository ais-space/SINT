        <Summary>
            The evaluation of urban development models revealed significant conflicts between the experts' perspectives, particularly between economic viability considerations and environmental sustainability. The Urban Planner emphasized the importance of efficient land use and transportation systems, the Environmental Scientist focused on resource consumption and carbon emissions, the Sociologist highlighted social equity and community formation issues, and the Economist prioritized development costs and affordability. The debates required iterative synthesis to reach a balanced perspective.

        <SynthesizedConclusion>
            Synthesis completed under Scenario: Conflict.
            The evaluation of urban development models revealed inherent tensions between environmental sustainability, social equity, and economic viability that required multiple rounds of debate and synthesis to address. While all experts agreed that compact city and transit-oriented development models were environmentally superior, significant disagreements emerged about implementation feasibility and social equity impacts. Through iterative synthesis, the experts converged on the importance of policy mechanisms to align economic incentives with sustainability goals. The final recommendation emphasizes using regulatory and market-based tools (carbon pricing, impact fees, equity requirements) to create urban development models that meet environmental thresholds while addressing economic and social concerns. Implementation should be phased, beginning with areas most suitable for sustainable development approaches.
