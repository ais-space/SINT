        <Summary>
            The analysis of healthcare systems found broad agreement among experts on the strengths and weaknesses of different models. All experts acknowledged that single-payer systems excel in providing universal access but may face challenges with wait times and innovation. Multi-payer systems were seen as balancing access and choice effectively, while private insurance systems offer maximum choice but often at the cost of equitable access.

            Synthesis completed under Scenario: Consensus.
            The healthcare system analysis revealed strong consensus among experts on key strengths and weaknesses of different models. All experts agreed that the most effective systems combine universal coverage with appropriate cost management mechanisms and strong primary care orientation. There was also consensus that no single model is optimal for all contexts, and healthcare system design should consider specific country factors including demographics, economic capacity, and political structures. The multi-payer model was generally seen as providing a good balance of competing objectives, though the specific implementation approach must be tailored to local contexts.
