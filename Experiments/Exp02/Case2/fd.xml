<SINT_Prompt_Task>
<Objective>
Run a conflict-oriented debate to evaluate trade-offs between accelerated yield gains and biosafety/acceptance constraints for region-wide deployment of gene-edited staple crops. Require detailed positions, numeric ratings (1-10), cross-critique, and iterative convergence.
</Objective>
<Context>
1. Regulatory approvals, containment protocols, labeling/traceability.
2. Agronomic constraints across smallholder vs. industrial scales.
3. English-only output; PCG grounding required.
4. Divergence Ratings and compromise proposals across rounds.
5. Dual Output + Verification Report are mandatory.

<Methodology>
Debates (N=3) with Step 3A (Conflict), at least 2 rounds with Divergence Ratings and compromise synthesis.
</Methodology>
<Finalization_Protocol>
1. Require ratings (1-10), cross-evaluation each round, explicit compromises.
2. Strict XML-only formatting; no leading spaces or HTML entities.
3. Enforce PCG; mark INVALID and self-correct if ungrounded.
4. MSV: stop and request clarification on contradictions/impossibilities.
5. Dual Output + Verification Report required.
</Finalization_Protocol>
<Verification>
Checks: pcg_compliance, xml_validity, objective_match, no_undeclared_assumptions; meta: consensus_score, iterations_used, fallback_flag.
</Verification>
