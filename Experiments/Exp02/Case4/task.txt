Title: Security Review Protocol for LLM Applications Handling Sensitive Data
Objective: Use Generator+Critic to produce a robust application security review protocol tailored to LLM-based systems processing PII and proprietary data.
Context: Threat models (prompt injection, data exfiltration), logging and redaction, access control, human-in-the-loop overrides, auditability.
Methodology: Generator + External Critic (N=2) with explicit feedback loops; mandatory corrections until constraints satisfied or limit reached.
Experts: Application Security Architect (Generator); Compliance and Risk Officer (Critic).
Constraints: PCG required; numeric ratings (1-10) for risk and coverage; Dual Output with Verification Report.
Expected Outcomes: Stepwise review protocol with gates, controls, test cases, red-team hooks, and rollback triggers.
Language: English only.
