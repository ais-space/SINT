<SINT_Prompt_Task>
<Objective>
Create a multi-agent debate that evaluates safety, efficiency, and ethical trade-offs in deploying autonomous delivery robots in dense urban environments. Require detailed positions, numerical ratings (1-10), cross-criticism, and iterative convergence under a conflict scenario.
</Objective>
<Context>
1. City logistics constraints, pedestrian safety norms, local regulations, and operational KPIs.
2. Include concrete examples: night-time deliveries, school zones, curb management.
3. All outputs must be in English and comply with PCG (trace back to Objective/Context).
4. Require Divergence Ratings and compromise proposals across rounds.
5. Dual Output and Verification Report are mandatory.
</Context>
<Consultants>
<Agent id="A1" focus="Urban Safety Regulation">Policies, pedestrian safety, compliance zones.</Agent>
<Agent id="A2" focus="Operations Optimization">Routing, throughput, SLAs, resource use.</Agent>
<Agent id="A3" focus="Ethics and Public Trust">Human factors, transparency, incident handling.</Agent>
</Consultants>
<Methodology>
Debates (N=3) with Step 3A (Conflict), minimum 2 rounds, with Divergence Ratings and compromise synthesis.
</Methodology>
<Finalization_Protocol>
1. Enforce ratings (1-10), cross-evaluation each round, and explicit compromise proposals.
2. Dual Output: Executive Summary (one-line + 3 bullets) + Synthesized Conclusion (XML) + Verification Report.
3. Strict XML-only formatting, no leading spaces, no HTML tags/entities.
4. PCG enforcement: all theses must reference Objective/Context; INVALID if not.
5. MSV: on contradictions/impossibility, stop and request clarification.
</Finalization_Protocol>
<Verification>
Checks: pcg_compliance, xml_validity, objective_match, no_undeclared_assumptions; meta: consensus_score, iterations_used, fallback_flag.
</Verification>
