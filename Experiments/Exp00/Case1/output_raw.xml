<Summary>
FD synthesized and SINT prompt generated under Debates (N=4). Proceeded via Scenario 3B (Consensus) for the meta-synthesis to ensure clarity and coverage of requirements. Four downstream tasks were produced for Cases 2–5 with specified methodologies.

<Task index="2" case="Case2">
<title>AI Safety Policy Trade-offs in Autonomous Urban Delivery</title>
<objective>Create a multi-agent debate that evaluates safety, efficiency, and ethical trade-offs in deploying autonomous delivery robots in dense urban environments. Require detailed positions, numerical ratings (1-10), cross-criticism, and iterative convergence under a conflict scenario.</objective>
<context>City logistics constraints, pedestrian safety norms, local regulations, and operational KPIs. Include concrete examples (e.g., night-time deliveries, school zones).</context>
<methodology>Debates (N=3) with Step 3A (Conflict) for at least 2 rounds, using Divergence Ratings and compromise proposals.</methodology>
<experts>
- Urban Safety Regulator
- Operations Optimization Engineer
- Ethics and Public Trust Specialist
</experts>
<constraints>PCG required; ratings and cross-evaluation mandatory each round; Dual Output with Verification Report.</constraints>
<expected_outcomes>Clear compromise principles for deployment policies, risk mitigations, and KPIs with thresholds.</expected_outcomes>

<Task index="3" case="Case3">
<title>Open-Source Sustainability Strategy for a Core ML Library</title>
<objective>Design a debate to integrate contributor growth, long-term funding, and stability guarantees into a cohesive sustainability roadmap for an open-source ML core library.</objective>
<context>Release cadence, backward compatibility, governance models, and sponsor expectations. Use real examples of policy options (LTS branches, RFC processes).</context>
<methodology>Debates (N=3) with Step 3B (Consensus). No criticism; focus on integration and prioritization.</methodology>

</Task>

<Task index="4" case="Case4">
<title>Model Evaluation Protocol under Data Drift</title>
<objective>Create a Generator+Critic workflow to build a robust evaluation protocol for ML systems facing covariate shift and data drift across quarters.</objective>
