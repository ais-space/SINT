<SINT_Prompt_Task>
<Objective>
Generate a complete Formal Definition (FD) enabling a SINT Code Generator to build a SINT prompt that yields 4 distinct complex analytical tasks, each requiring a unique interdisciplinary setup with numeric ratings (1-10), cross-evaluation, iterative convergence, and Dual Output.
</Objective>
<Context>
1. The 4 tasks must occupy clearly different domains to probe generalization.
2. Each task must enforce ratings, cross-critique, and multi-round synthesis.
3. English-only output with strict PCG (link every thesis to Objective/Context).
4. Each task must prescribe a precise methodology and agent roles fit to the domain.
5. Outputs must be XML-only, audit-ready, with a Verification Report.
</Context>
<Consultants>
<Agent id="A1" focus="Robust Experiment Design">Maximizes observable variability while keeping traceability.</Agent>
<Agent id="A2" focus="Method–Domain Fit">Maps debate/critic patterns to domain conflict structure.</Agent>
<Agent id="A3" focus="Metrics & Validity">Ratings, thresholds, cross-eval, verification checks.</Agent>
<Agent id="A4" focus="Domain Breadth">Ensures non-overlapping domains and realistic constraints.</Agent>
</Consultants>
<Methodology>
Use Debates (N=4) for this System Designer step. The 4 tasks must mandate:
- Case 2: Debates (N=3) with Step 3A (Conflict)
- Case 3: Debates (N=3) with Step 3B (Consensus)
- Case 4: Generator + External Critic (N=2)
- Case 5: Debates (N=4) with Step 3A (Conflict)
</Methodology>
<Finalization_Protocol>
1. Enforce PCG with INVALID/self-correct rule for ungrounded theses.
2. Require ratings (1-10), cross-evaluation, and iterative synthesis.
3. Dual Output: Executive Summary (one line + three bullets) + Synthesized Conclusion (XML) + Verification Report.
4. Strict XML-only formatting (no markdown, no HTML, no leading spaces).
5. MSV: stop and request clarification on contradictions/impossibility.
</Finalization_Protocol>
<Verification>
Checks: pcg_compliance, xml_validity, objective_match, no_undeclared_assumptions;
meta: consensus_score (0-10), iterations_used (0-2), fallback_flag (boolean).
</Verification>
