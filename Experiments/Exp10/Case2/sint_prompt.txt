    2. Principle of Contextual Grounding (PCG): Any new thesis/conclusion must explicitly reference elements in <Context> or <Objective>.

    5. PCG-Failure Action: If a thesis cannot be correlated with <Context> or <Objective>, mark it as INVALID and require self-correction in the next message.

<Objective>
<![CDATA[A comprehensive analysis of climate change mitigation strategies where economists, environmental scientists, and policy experts debate the optimal balance between economic growth and environmental preservation. Experts must provide numerical ratings (1-10) for different strategies, engage in cross-criticism, and achieve iterative convergence on the most viable approaches.]]>

<Context>
    <key_facts max_items="5"><![CDATA[Numbered key facts for PCG: 1. Climate change mitigation strategies affect both economic and environmental systems; 2. Different strategies have varying cost-benefit ratios; 3. Implementation feasibility varies by region and governance structure; 4. Environmental benefits require long-term perspective; 5. Economic impacts can be immediate or long-term]]]></key_facts>

<Methodology>
Expert Debates (N >= 3) with Conflict Scenario (Step 3A) approach to ensure deep synthesis between conflicting economic and environmental priorities.

<SynthesisEngine>
Step 0: Validation Phase (MSV).
The Executor (LLM) must conduct a logical pre-filter of the <Objective> and <Methodology> for internal contradictions or impossible instructions. If a conflict is found, stop the process and request clarification.

Step 1: Initialization Phase.
Each Consultant formulates their initial position (max 2 sentences) on the <Objective> within their <Focus>.

Step 2: Divergence and Conflict Assessment Phase.
Each Consultant assigns a Divergence Rating (1-10) to all positions.
Conflict Assessment: If at least one agent assigns a Divergence Rating < 3 (Defective/Dangerous) to an opponent's position, proceed to Step 3A (Criticism Phase). Otherwise, proceed to Step 3B (Integration Phase - Default Path).

Step 3A: Criticism Phase (Conflict Scenario).
All consultants provide collective criticism. Each Consultant: 1) Highlights the best thesis. 2) Points out a vulnerable thesis. 3) Proposes a compromise (max 2 sentences). All theses must comply with PCG.

Step 3B: Integration Phase (Consensus Scenario).
Consultants do not criticize. Each Consultant integrates relevant theses (Rating >= 3), prioritizing them by importance to the <Objective>. All theses must comply with PCG.

Step 4: Iterative Convergence/Final Synthesis.
If Scenario 3A (Conflict) was chosen: A maximum of 2 debate rounds are conducted. Before each round, the LLM must generate a brief Summary of Progress to maintain context. On failure (Consensus < 7/10), a fallback partial_consensus is formed.
If Scenario 3B (Consensus) was chosen: Proceed directly to Step 5.

Step 4.5: Extraction and Structuring.
Extract only PCG-valid compromise theses with a rating >= 7/10 and structure them into groups (<KeyFinding>, <RiskAssessment>). Use attributes source="fact_N" and consultant="Agent_ID" for traceability.

Step 5: Finalization Phase.
Finalize: form the public output (Executive Summary) + Synthesized Conclusion (XML) + Verification Report.
