    1. Execution of <SynthesisEngine> is strictly line-by-line.
    2. Principle of Contextual Grounding (PCG): Any new thesis/conclusion must explicitly reference elements in <Context> or <Objective>.
    3. Direct use or citation of pre-existing heuristics is forbidden.
    4. Synthesis is prioritized over citation.
    5. PCG-Failure Action: If a thesis cannot be correlated with <Context> or <Objective>, mark it as INVALID and require self-correction in the next message.

<Objective>
<![CDATA[A critical analysis of AI's impact on employment markets where a technology expert generates projections and scenarios while an economist provides comprehensive feedback and critique. The process includes feedback loops and detailed analysis from both perspectives.]]>
</Objective>

<Context>
    <key_facts max_items="5"><![CDATA[Numbered key facts for PCG: 1. AI capabilities are advancing rapidly across multiple domains; 2. Historical precedent shows technology creates and displaces jobs; 3. Labor markets require time to adjust to technological shifts; 4. Automation potential varies significantly by job type and industry; 5. Economic and social policies influence market outcomes]]]></key_facts>
    <source_data><![CDATA[Expert Panel: Expert E1: AI/Technology Expert, focusing on technical capabilities and development trends; Expert E2: Labor Economist, focusing on economic implications and market dynamics.

<Methodology>
Generator + External Critic (N = 2) with comprehensive feedback loops to ensure detailed analysis from both technical and economic perspectives.

<SynthesisEngine>
Step 0: Validation Phase (MSV).
The Executor (LLM) must conduct a logical pre-filter of the <Objective> and <Methodology> for internal contradictions or impossible instructions. If a conflict is found, stop the process and request clarification.

Step 1: Initialization Phase.
Each Consultant formulates their initial position (max 2 sentences) on the <Objective> within their <Focus>.

Step 2: Divergence and Conflict Assessment Phase.
Each Consultant assigns a Divergence Rating (1-10) to all positions.
Conflict Assessment: If at least one agent assigns a Divergence Rating < 3 (Defective/Dangerous) to an opponent's position, proceed to Step 3A (Criticism Phase). Otherwise, proceed to Step 3B (Integration Phase - Default Path).

Step 3A: Criticism Phase (Conflict Scenario).
All consultants provide collective criticism. Each Consultant: 1) Highlights the best thesis. 2) Points out a vulnerable thesis. 3) Proposes a compromise (max 2 sentences). All theses must comply with PCG.

Step 3B: Integration Phase (Consensus Scenario).
Consultants do not criticize. Each Consultant integrates relevant theses (Rating >= 3), prioritizing them by importance to the <Objective>. All theses must comply with PCG.

Step 4: Iterative Convergence/Final Synthesis.
If Scenario 3A (Conflict) was chosen: A maximum of 2 debate rounds are conducted. Before each round, the LLM must generate a brief Summary of Progress to maintain context. On failure (Consensus < 7/10), a fallback partial_consensus is formed.
If Scenario 3B (Consensus) was chosen: Proceed directly to Step 5.

Step 4.5: Extraction and Structuring.
Extract only PCG-valid compromise theses with a rating >= 7/10 and structure them into groups (<KeyFinding>, <RiskAssessment>). Use attributes source="fact_N" and consultant="Agent_ID" for traceability.

Step 5: Finalization Phase.
Finalize: form the public output (Executive Summary) + Synthesized Conclusion (XML) + Verification Report.
