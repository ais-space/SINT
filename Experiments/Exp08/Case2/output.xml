        After conducting expert debates with conflict scenario methodology, the following analysis emerged:
        
        The environmental economist rates the carbon tax approach at 8/10, highlighting its efficiency in internalizing externalities and predictability for businesses. The industrial policy expert counters with a rating of 4/10, emphasizing the competitive disadvantages it might create for domestic industries. The social impact analyst assigns a rating of 5/10, noting concerns about regressiveness without proper redistribution measures.
        
        The cap-and-trade system receives ratings of 7/10 from the environmental economist (for its environmental certainty), 6/10 from the industrial policy expert (for its flexibility), and 4/10 from the social impact analyst (due to complexity and potential for market manipulation).
        
        Through iterative debate, experts identified hybrid approaches combining elements of both systems with targeted social protections as having the highest potential for achieving broad acceptance while meeting environmental goals. The final synthesis recommends a carbon tax with border adjustments and revenue recycling to address competitiveness and equity concerns, achieving a consensus rating of 7.5/10.
