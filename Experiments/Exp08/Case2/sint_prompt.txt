    Execution of <SynthesisEngine> is strictly line-by-line.
    Principle of Contextual Grounding (PCG): Any new thesis/conclusion must explicitly reference elements in <Context> or <Objective>.
    Direct use or citation of pre-existing heuristics is forbidden.
    Synthesis is prioritized over citation.
    PCG-Failure Action: If a thesis cannot be correlated with <Context> or <Objective>, mark it as INVALID and require self-correction in the next message.

    <source_data><![CDATA[Climate change policies require balancing environmental benefits with economic costs across various sectors and populations. The task involves analyzing the global economic impact of climate change policies with experts in environmental economics, industrial policy, and social impact assessment engaging in structured debate with numerical ratings and iterative convergence.]]>

</Context>

<Methodology>
Expert Debates (N=3) with Conflict scenario due to fundamentally opposing stakeholder interests.
</Methodology>

<Consultants>
<Consultant id="1" role="Environmental Economist" focus="Economic modeling of environmental policies and their long-term impacts"/>
<Consultant id="2" role="Industrial Policy Expert" focus="Effects of environmental regulations on industrial competitiveness and growth"/>
<Consultant id="3" role="Social Impact Analyst" focus="Distributional effects of climate policies on different socioeconomic groups"/>
</Consultants>

<SynthesisEngine>
Step 0: Validation Phase (MSV).
The Executor (LLM) must conduct a logical pre-filter of the <Objective> and <Methodology> for internal contradictions or impossible instructions. If a conflict is found, stop the process and request clarification.

Step 1: Initialization Phase.
Each Consultant formulates their initial position (max 2 sentences) on the <Objective> within their <Focus>.

Step 2: Divergence and Conflict Assessment Phase.
Each Consultant assigns a Divergence Rating (1-10) to all positions.
Conflict Assessment: If at least one agent assigns a Divergence Rating < 3 (Defective/Dangerous) to an opponent's position, proceed to Step 3A (Criticism Phase). Otherwise, proceed to Step 3B (Integration Phase - Default Path).

Step 3A: Criticism Phase (Conflict Scenario).
All consultants provide collective criticism. Each Consultant: 1) Highlights the best thesis. 2) Points out a vulnerable thesis. 3) Proposes a compromise (max 2 sentences). All theses must comply with PCG.

Step 3B: Integration Phase (Consensus Scenario).
Consultants do not criticize. Each Consultant integrates relevant theses (Rating >= 3), prioritizing them by importance to the <Objective>. All theses must comply with PCG.

Step 4: Iterative Convergence/Final Synthesis.
If Scenario 3A (Conflict) was chosen: A maximum of 2 debate rounds are conducted. Before each round, the LLM must generate a brief Summary of Progress to maintain context. On failure (Consensus < 7/10), a fallback partial_consensus is formed.
If Scenario 3B (Consensus) was chosen: Proceed directly to Step 5.

Step 4.5: Extraction and Structuring.
Extract only PCG-valid compromise theses with a rating >= 7/10 and structure them into groups (<KeyFinding>, <RiskAssessment>). Use attributes source="fact_N" and consultant="Agent_ID" for traceability.

Step 5: Finalization Phase.
Finalize: form the public output (Executive Summary) + Synthesized Conclusion (XML) + Verification Report.
