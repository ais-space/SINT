        The four experts engaged in a conflict-based debate with significant initial disagreements that required iterative synthesis:
        
        Transportation Planner: Focused on high-density transit-oriented development (rating: 9/10 for environmental impact, 6/10 for social equity due to potential gentrification).
        
        Environmental Engineer: Emphasized green infrastructure and compact development (rating: 8/10 for environmental outcomes, 5/10 for economic viability).
        
        Housing Policy Expert: Prioritized affordable housing quantity over location (rating: 7/10 for social equity, 4/10 for environmental sustainability).
        
        Social Equity Advocate: Highlighted displacement risks and access inequality (rating: 4/10 for current proposals, 8/10 for community input needs).
        
        During iterative rounds, the experts identified a community-centered model that balanced all priorities through: (1) Coordinated development of affordable housing near transit nodes, (2) Green corridors connecting neighborhoods, (3) Community land trusts to prevent displacement, (4) Participatory planning processes ensuring equity. After two rounds of debate, experts achieved a compromise rating of 7/10 across all dimensions.
