        The AI Ethics Specialist proposed initial ethical guidelines focusing on bias mitigation, algorithmic transparency, and accountability measures. The Healthcare Regulatory Expert then critically evaluated these proposals for regulatory compliance and clinical feasibility.
        
        Initial Proposal (Generator): Comprehensive bias testing protocols, explainable AI requirements, and clear accountability frameworks received ratings of 9/10 for ethical rigor but only 5/10 for implementation practicality.
        
        Critic's Assessment: The regulatory expert noted that while the ethical framework was sound, implementation would require significant changes to existing FDA approval processes and clinical workflows. Several requirements were flagged as potentially conflicting with patient privacy regulations (6/10 compliance rating).
        
        After incorporating the critic's feedback, the refined guidelines achieved stronger practicality (7/10) while maintaining ethical standards (8/10). The final framework includes: (1) Mandatory bias testing with diverse datasets, (2) Risk-based regulatory pathways for AI diagnostic tools, (3) Clinician training requirements for AI system oversight, (4) Patient consent protocols for AI-assisted diagnosis. The integrated solution achieved a consensus rating of 8/10.
