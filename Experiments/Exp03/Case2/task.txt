Title: AI-Driven Wildfire Response: Detection Latency vs. False Alarm Risk
Objective: Run a conflict debate balancing rapid detection and low false-alarm rates in AI-assisted wildfire monitoring and dispatch.
Context: Sensor fusion, satellite vs. UAV cadence, dispatch protocols, resource constraints, public safety messaging.
Methodology: Debates (N=3) with Step 3A (Conflict), ≥2 rounds with Divergence Ratings and compromise synthesis.
Experts: Fire Behavior Scientist; Remote Sensing and Perception Engineer; Emergency Dispatch and Public Safety Officer.
Constraints: PCG; numeric ratings each round; cross-evaluation; Dual Output + Verification.
Expected Outcomes: Operational thresholds and dispatch triggers with KPIs and safeguards.
Language: English only.
