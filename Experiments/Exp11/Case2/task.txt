# Task: Climate Change Mitigation Strategies: Economic vs Environmental vs Social Perspectives

## Description
Analysis of climate change mitigation strategies from three conflicting viewpoints: economic costs, environmental urgency, and social equity considerations.

## Experts
### Expert 1: Economist
**Position:** Market-based solutions like carbon pricing are most effective
**Arguments:**
1. Carbon pricing provides efficient market incentives
2. Minimal government intervention required
3. Cost-effective implementation at scale

**Rating:** 7.5/10
**Evidence:**
- Successful EU Emissions Trading System
- Economic modeling studies

### Expert 2: Environmental Scientist
**Position:** Immediate regulatory measures are necessary
**Arguments:**
1. Climate crisis requires urgent action
2. Market mechanisms are too slow
3. Need for binding emissions targets

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Evidence:**
- IPCC climate reports
- Temperature rise data

### Expert 3: Social Justice Advocate
**Position:** Equity-focused approaches must take precedence
**Arguments:**
1. Poor communities bear disproportionate costs
2. Climate policies must address social justice
3. Just transition for workers is essential

**Rating:** 8.0/10
**Evidence:**
- Environmental justice studies
- Global inequality data

## Cross-Criticism
- Economist to Environmental Scientist: Regulation might be economically inefficient and lead to unintended consequences
- Economist to Social Justice Advocate: Economic growth is necessary to fund social programs
- Environmental Scientist to Economist: Market mechanisms have failed to address climate urgency
- Environmental Scientist to Social Justice Advocate: Environmental collapse would harm all communities
- Social Justice Advocate to Economist: Market failures require government intervention
- Social Justice Advocate to Environmental Scientist: Environment policy must consider vulnerable populations

## Iterative Convergence
**Synthesis:** A hybrid approach combining market mechanisms with regulatory requirements and social safeguards
**Agreed Elements:** Need for urgent action, diverse approaches, protection of vulnerable populations
**Compromise Rating:** 8.0/10
