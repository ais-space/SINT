# SINT PROMPT: Generation of Diverse Complex Analytical Tasks

## Project: Generation of Diverse Complex Analytical Tasks
**Customer:** SINT Research Laboratory
**Objective:** Generate 4 different complex analytical tasks requiring unique interdisciplinary approaches with detailed expert analysis, numerical ratings, iterative convergence, and comprehensive synthesis.

---

## TASK GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS

You are tasked with generating 4 distinct complex analytical tasks that satisfy the following specifications:

### Task 1: Debates (N=3) + Conflict (Step 3A)
Create a complex analytical task that requires 3 experts engaging in debates with conflicting viewpoints. The task must include:
- Detailed expert positions with opposing viewpoints
- Numerical ratings (1-10) for each position
- Cross-criticism between experts
- Iterative convergence toward resolution
- Specific examples and data points supporting each position

### Task 2: Debates (N=3) + Consensus (Step 3B)
Create a complex analytical task that requires 3 experts working toward consensus. The task must include:
- Structured rating system for different approaches
- Detailed arguments supporting various options
- Multi-round synthesis process
- Clear methodology for consensus building
- Evidence-based recommendations

### Task 3: Generator + Critic (N=2)
Create a complex analytical task that employs a Generator-Critic model with 2 experts. The task must include:
- Comprehensive feedback loops between the Generator and Critic
- Detailed analysis of proposed solutions
- Iterative refinement process
- Critical evaluation of assumptions and methodologies
- Continuous improvement mechanisms

### Task 4: Debates (N=4) + Conflict (Step 3A)
Create a complex analytical task that requires 4 experts engaging in debates with significant conflicts. The task must include:
- Numerical ratings (1-10) for different perspectives
- Cross-evaluation between all experts
- Iterative synthesis process
- Complex problem with multiple stakeholder viewpoints
- Detailed resolution pathways

## GENERATION REQUIREMENTS

1. **Thematic Diversity**: All 4 tasks must be fundamentally different in theme and approach
2. **Expert Analysis**: Each task requires detailed expert positions with concrete examples
3. **Numerical Ratings**: All expert positions must include ratings on 1-10 scale
4. **Cross-Evaluation**: Experts must evaluate each other's positions
5. **Iterative Process**: Each task must include rounds of criticism and synthesis
6. **Language**: All output must be in English

## DELIVERABLES

Generate 4 complete analytical tasks that adhere to the above specifications. Each task should be self-contained with:
- Clear problem statement
- Defined expert roles and positions
- Evaluation criteria
- Expected outcomes
- Methodology for resolution

**OUTPUT FORMAT**:
For each task, provide the complete task description with all required elements specified above.
