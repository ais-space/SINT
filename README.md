## Abstract

The SINT v2.2 framework is a methodology for structured analysis of complex tasks using large language models (LLM). This version introduces mechanisms to enhance robustness against LLM errors (hallucinations, context forgetfulness) through the **Principle of Contextual Grounding (PCG)** and **strict pre-validation (Step 0)**. The architecture is optimized for **efficient consensus synthesis** (Step 3B — default path) and generation of **clean, machine-readable XML code** with a mandatory **Verification Report**.

**Keywords:** prompt-engineering, multi-agent systems, XML reasoning, SINT framework, contextual grounding, AI methodology
